# Unit-5-Challenge
## Homework assignment for Unit 5: Third-Party APIs

## Having read the instructions, I have, to the best of my abilities, done the following:

- modified the provided files so that a daily agenda is dispalyed in one-hour increments, with 1 task savable per hour
- created a JavaScript file to handle the various dynamic elements of the page, including color of agenda box (gray for past, red for present, green for future); saving tasks entered to a local storage object; retrieving from local storage on page load
- added screenshots and links to this readme for the deployed application repo
- pushed my files to GitHub and deployed them to a live site through GitHub
- submitted the deployed application URL and GitHub repo to BCS for review and grading
